# Python Core – 42 Porto

This repository contains Python exercises and small scripts developed during my studies at 42 Porto, as part of the Common Core (Python track).

The focus is on strengthening core programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and clean, readable code through hands-on practice.

Topics include:
- Python syntax and control flow
- Functions and modules
- Data structures
- Basic automation scripts

This repository reflects my ongoing learning process.

# Python Core – 42 Porto

This repository contains Python projects and exercises developed during the **42 Porto Common Core – Python track (Milestone 2)**.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen core programming concepts through hands-on, project-based learning, following the peer-to-peer and self-driven methodology of 42.

Each module focuses on specific Python concepts and progressively increases in complexity, reinforcing problem-solving skills, code organization, and software design fundamentals.
