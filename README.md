# Python Core – 42 Porto

This repository contains Python exercises and small scripts developed during my studies at 42 Porto, as part of the Common Core (Python track).

The focus is on strengthening core programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and clean, readable code through hands-on practice.

Topics include:
- Python syntax and control flow
- Functions and modules
- Data structures
- Basic automation scripts

This repository reflects my ongoing learning process.
