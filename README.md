Repository representing my progression through **Milestone 2 (Python)** of the **42 Porto Common Core**.

This repository focuses on **Python fundamentals and software engineering discipline**, following a structured progression from basic concepts to more advanced design topics.

---

## 🎯 Context

The **42 curriculum** is a **project-based, peer-to-peer software engineering program** with no traditional classes, teachers, or lectures.

Learning is driven by:
- Hands-on projects  
- Peer evaluations  
- Autonomy and problem-solving  
- Strong emphasis on code quality and reasoning  

This repository reflects that methodology in practice.

## 🧠 Skills & Topics Covered

- Python fundamentals  
- Control flow and data structures  
- Exception handling and defensive programming  
- File handling and streams  
- Modular project organization  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Design patterns  
- Environment configuration  
- Functional programming concepts

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents an independent learning module, designed to strengthen specific programming concepts:

```
module-00 → Python basics and control flow
module-01 → Functions, encapsulation & intro to OOP
module-02 → Exceptions and error handling
module-03 → Data processing and analytics logic
module-04 → File handling and streams
module-05 → Data pipelines and flow control
module-06 → Modules, packages, and imports
module-07 → Object-Oriented design patterns
module-08 → Environment configuration & dependencies
module-09 → Advanced project configuration
module-10 → Functional programming concepts
```

> 🔎 **Reviewer tip:** start with `module-00` and `module-01` for fundamentals, then jump to later modules to see architectural and design maturity.
